The idea of this branch is to explore making a version of nethack that
focusses on giving proactive hints to the player, thus reducing the need
to rely on the wiki or irc to spoil the player.

* A Brief List of Ideas to Explore

** Recommended Classes

   i.e. Ascend a Lawful Female Dwarven Valkyre, /then/ a wizard, etc.

   When starting to play noobhack, you always start as a LFDV until you've
   ascended that class. Then, you always start as Chaotic Male Elven
   Wizard, perhaps even with locked stats or inventory.

   The idea is to approach the game as a series of increasingly difficult
   classes, as the starter guide recommends.

** In game, reliable tips.

   Pro-actively inform the player of things they'd otherwise have to die
   to learn or be extremely observant to notice.

*** Monster Help

    First time monsters are seen, display a paragraph of health tips about
    them, maybe with rough stats and whether or not you should consider
    them dangerous?

*** ???

** Stabilized Prices (locked charisma?)

   Possibly accompanied with a guide to how price helps you identify items
   of different classes.

** Triggered Events

*** Gnomish Mines

*** Message Interpretation

    i.e. 'you hearâ€¦' popping up a message about what it means.
